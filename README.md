# Arrow: A Configurable RISC-V Vector Accelerator for Machine Learning

  RISC-V implementation of a vector accelerator that will eventually be used to accelerate Machine Learning algorithms. We are compliant with latest version of the [RISC-V Vector ISA](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec) (currently v1.0).
  We plan on supporting special types such as bfloat16 and posits to accelerate these workloads.
  
  More details can be found in our [report](https://github.com/ERCL-AUB/arrow/blob/master/doc/FYP_Report.pdf) and [paper](https://github.com/ERCL-AUB/arrow/blob/master/doc/Arrow_CARRV2021.pdf).
